# Barcode Finder

This app is my personal project as extension on our warehouse system. Before , to find the master barcode of transfers, invoices, damages and received items, I need to go to our office to find the paper where the barcode was attached manually. It takes a lot of time , effort and I always disturb our data entry / archive personnel. With this app I can easily manage to store invoice details and generate barcode which I can use to scan all qr codes and barcode of all the items I received.
